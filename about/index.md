## What the hell is this place all about?

*Existential* - __Relating to the existence of a thing.__

*Test*        - __A procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something__

Somethings we all 'know':

1. When software reaches a customer, it should work in a manner they expect.
2. We only have a set amount of resources to deliver the software
2. Code with quality issues is likely to impact #1, or #2 or both.

This site discusses techniques developers and testers can adopt to improve the efficiency of
delivering code. Initially we will be covering techniques that support the agile methodology, so
testing in multiple cycles a day with automated tests linked with continuous integration servers right
the way through to agile reporting techniques.
