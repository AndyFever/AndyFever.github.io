## What is the Rapid Testing site all about?

This is a blog about...well there's a clue in the title. Testing is a function that provides feedback on aspects of software like quality, performance and such. Rapid Testing is about providing this feedback to stakeholders as part of a continuous integration cycle.

Integrating testing into continuous integration frameworks can be hard, very hard. This is is especially true if you are working in an environment that needs large amounts of manual testing.

This site discusses various approaches to successfully speeding up software testing. We will be covering:

- Business Driven Development
- Acceptance Test Automation
- Requirements Gathering
- Unit Testing vs Acceptance Testing
- Setting up Test Frameworks
- Test Communications
