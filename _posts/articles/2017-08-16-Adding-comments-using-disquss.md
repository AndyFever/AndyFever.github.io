Disqus is a pretty cool plugin that allows you to enter comments onto blogs using your own avatar. It also saves a
shed load of coding through the back end as it used a simple API.

Just go to the [Disqus](https://disqus.com/home/) homepage and setup your account.

Then, once you have an account, when you navigate to an article that has comments enabled, you should see the comments
box at the bottom of the page.
