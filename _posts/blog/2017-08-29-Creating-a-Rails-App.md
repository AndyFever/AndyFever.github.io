This is a quick guide for setting up rails.

To get started, just the rails command will tell you what options you have. The forst one we are going to be using is
 ```bash
rails new <app_name>
```
This will generate the skeleton for your rails app. CD into the directory and run 'rails' again to see what application specific commands you can run.
