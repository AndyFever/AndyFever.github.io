You've got your team trained and working as a tight knit unit, which is a relief as you have a big project that you need to deliver in a few weeks and you're still finding issues at a rate that makes you uncomfortable. Then you get some requests to 'work from home' from your team.

How this will make you feel will depend on a lot of factors, including your company culture, the processes you use and how much you trust your team. Now the weird thing is - I used to be fairly relaxed about these requests, but as I've gone on I have noticed I try and discourage them more and more. I get people can't always be available, we all have emergency situations that require us to be at home.  But, let me explain why I've changed my position on this.

#### Agile and Working in a Team Environment

Technical managers work hard on developing teams that fit into a company culture. Aligning developers, testers into the business function takes a lot of work (and significant financial cost). The upside of this investment is that you have a cross-functional team colocated together and responding rapidly to requirements (and defects). You've also spent a lot of time homing your processes to get the most out yo teams. The few formalised meetings you have (for example, the daily scrum) are rapid. Once the meeting finished, people will break out to solve problems that arose. The interactions described here are part of what gives a development team its speed. People dialing are still involved, but it is never to the same extent as the people present.  They can easily become the weak link in the chain.

#### Collective Responsibility

One of the things I like most about Agile is there is a lot less emphasis on Project Managers with clipboards chasing people for updates. The whole team is responsible for delivering. They aren't measured by a progress bar on a Gantt chart, they're measured by delivering working software. This puts the responsibility onto the team to make sure everyone is delivering, it is much harder for the team to do this if that line of communication gets repeatably broken. It is also can be harder to do things like code reviews or buddy development in these situations.

#### Mitigation

I mentioned that a lot of this depends on company culture. The technology and working practices exist to help get around these issues. Some of the best I have found are:

- Instant Messaging -  Get a good instant messaging system that allows the team to communicate quickly and easily both publicly and privately. Make sure you have a solution that can use integrations and has formatting for code. Skype maybe good for the non-techie people on the team (and allows you to chat with friends), but it is next to useless for discussing code. [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) or [Slack](https://slack.com) are the market leaders (and the best)

- Video Conferencing - Make sure that you have a place you can use every week that allows you to run retrospectives. People need to be able to join and contribute easily. You also may need different people running the meeting at different times as features are demonstrated. This should be quick and painless. Remember, you probably all aren't on the same OS, you may have a mix of Unix, Mac and Windows based systems.

- Process Weak Links - This will be the case even if we weren't talking about working from home (usually through a respective). But if the manager gives permission for team members to work fro home, they need to be responsible for processes being carried out. In my experience, code reviews done remotely are problematic and end up being long threads in GitHub. Make sure the team know the purpose of a process and how to recognise the anti-patterns when it starts to go wrong.
