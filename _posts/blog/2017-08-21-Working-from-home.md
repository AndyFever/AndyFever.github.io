You’ve got your team trained and working as a unit. This is a relief as you have a big project that you need to deliver in a few weeks and you’re still finding issues. Then you get a request for a new feature to be bundled into the release. Then, when your day can't get worse, you get some requests to ‘work from home’ from your team.

How this will make you feel will depend on a lot of factors. These include your company culture, the processes you use and how much you trust your team. The weird thing is, I used to be cool about these requests, but as I’ve gone on I have noticed I try and discourage them. I get people can’t always be available, we all have emergency situations that need us to be at home. But, let me explain why I’ve changed my position on this.

#### Agile and Working in a Team Environment

Technical managers work hard on developing teams that fit into a company culture. Aligning developers, testers into the business function takes a lot of work and cost.  You’ve also spent a lot of time homing your processes to get the most out your teams. This investment means you've a cross functional team woking together.

The few formalised meetings you have (for example, the daily scrum) are rapid. Once the meeting finished, people will break out to solve problems that arose. The interactions described here are part of what gives a development team its speed. People dialling are still involved, but it is never to the same extent as the people present. They can become the weak link in the chain.

#### Collective Responsibility

One of the things I like most about Agile is there is a lot less emphasis on Project Management. Communication and delivery is the responsibility of the whole team. They aren’t measured by a progress bar on a Gantt chart, they’re measured by delivering working software. If the line of communication breaks then it makes it harder for the team to deliver. It is also can be harder to do things like code reviews or buddy development in these situations.

#### Mitigation

I mentioned that a lot of this depends on company culture. The technology and working practices exist to help get around these issues. Some of the best I have found are:

- Get a good instant messaging system that allows the team to communicate as they decide to. Make sure you have a solution that can use integrations and has formatting for code. Skype can be good for the non-techie people on the team but it is next to not great for discussing code. [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) or [Slack](https://slack.com) are the market leaders (and the best)

- Make sure that you have a video conference area you can use weekly that allows you to run retrospectives. People need to be able to join and contribute without stress. Demoing different functional areas requires different people running the meeting at different times.

- Remember, there's a good chance you aren’t on the same OS, you may have a mix of Unix, Mac and Windows based systems.

- Process weak links arising from team members being away will need to be resolved by the whole team. In my experience, code reviews done remotely are problematic. You want to avoid  long threads in GitHub.  Make sure the team know the purpose of a process and how to recognise the anti-patterns when it starts to go wrong.
